                Devil May Cry 3: Dante's Awakening[b] is a 2005 action-adventure game developed and published by Capcom.
                The game is a prequel to the original Devil May Cry, featuring a younger Dante.
                [4] Set a decade before the events of the first Devil May Cry in an enchanted tower,
                Temen-ni-gru, the story centers on the dysfunctional relationship between Dante and his brother Vergil.
                The game introduces combat mechanics with an emphasis on combos and fast-paced action. 
                The story is told primarily in cutscenes using the game's engine, with several pre-rendered full motion videos.
                Devil May Cry 3 was released in February and March 2005 for the PlayStation 2 and ported to Windows in June and October 2006. 
                It was widely praised by critics, hailing it as a return to form for the series, 
                yet did receive some criticisms for its high level of difficulty in the North American release.
                [5][6] It was re‐released in 2006 as Devil May Cry 3: Special Edition[c], featuring retooled difficulty levels, 
                the addition of mid-mission checkpoints, "GOLD mode", and Vergil as a playable character. 
                Combined sales of both versions were over 2.3 million. It has been cited as one of the greatest video games ever made.
